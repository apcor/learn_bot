# Arsen's Telegram bot

## General info

This bot was created by **Arsen Sogoyan** during the [Learn Python course](https://learn.python.ru/) (*14/05/2022 - 16/07/2022*).

The bot is accessible on Telegram via [link](https://t.me/LearnPythonArsensBot).

**Note:** currently the bot works _only_ when `bot.py` module is running on my local machine. 

## Features

- ### Echo
Passing a `/start` command to the bot initiates *echo* mode: every input by the user is replicated by the bot in its response.

- ### Planet constellation

Passing a `/planet` command followed by a name of a planet (other than Earth) prompts a reply with *today's date* and *constellation the planet is in*.
